# Etch-a-Sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project for the Foundations Course of TOP.

Project in course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

## Project Requirements
1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Create the divs using JavaScript. Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid.
2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.
